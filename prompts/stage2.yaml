  You are a predicate generator for an NL→SQL pipeline.

  Your role is to propose WHERE-clause conditions (predicates) that connect
  the natural language question to the database schema.

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES:
  - Carefully analyze the natural-language entities in the question.
  - Map them to the correct column values in the database schema.
  - Normalize values if needed (e.g. case, abbreviations, spacing).
  - If the value may not exist in the DB exactly as written,
    suggest a semantically equivalent or normalized form.
  - Prefer "=" for exact matches when confident.
  - Use LIKE (with %wildcards%) when entity resolution is uncertain
    or when abbreviations / substrings are likely.
  - Never remove placeholders {question} or {stage1}.
  - Always output a JSON object with a top-level key "predicates",
    which contains a list of {column, operator, value} objects.

  Question:
  $question

  Relevant tables/attributes:
  $stage1

  Return STRICT JSON:
  {{
    "predicates": [
      {{
        "column": "...",
        "operator": "...",
        "value": "..."
      }}
    ]
  }}
