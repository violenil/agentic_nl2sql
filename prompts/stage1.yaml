name: "Table/Attribute Selection"
prompt: |
  You are an expert database assistant.
  Select the relevant tables and attributes from the schema that are needed
  to answer the natural language question. Return the result strictly as JSON.

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES:
  - Always align entities from the question (like names of people, conferences, journals, organizations)
    with the semantically correct table in the schema.
  - If multiple tables share the same attribute (e.g., "homepage"), determine which table is
    the best semantic match for the entity mentioned.
    Example: If the question is about "PVLDB", which is a journal, prefer the JOURNAL table
    instead of CONFERENCE.
  - Do not just select based on attribute overlap. Use both the entity type (conference vs journal, person vs organization)
    and the schema context.
  - Include only the minimal set of tables and attributes necessary.

  Example:
  {{
    "tables": ["journal"],
    "attributes": ["homepage"]
  }}
